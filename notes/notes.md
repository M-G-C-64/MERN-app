### JSX

    - A syntax for Java script which looks like html, but converts JSX to JS syntax
    - Useful mainly for nesting html elements (normal JS syntax is difficult for nesting)

### Component

    - can be function
    - class that renders html
    - componets always start with **uppercase** (otherwise considers as a builtin HTML tag)

### MISC

    - No class, instead **className**
